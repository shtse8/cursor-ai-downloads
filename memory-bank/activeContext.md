## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Review Dependencies**: Examine `package.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. (Current Focus)
2.  **Data Cleanup (Optional/Future)**: Address potential duplicate entries and missing links in `version-history.json`.
3.  **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitor workflow runs (both update and deployment) and address any future data inconsistencies or API changes from Cursor.
4.  **GitHub Pages Site Enhancements (Future)**: Consider adding platform filtering or other improvements based on usage.

## 4. Active Decisions

- Confirmed the primary update mechanism now correctly relies on `update-cursor-links.ts` followed by `update-readme-from-history.ts` executed via the GitHub Action.
- Confirmed the GitHub Pages site will be deployed automatically from the `docs/` directory via a separate GitHub Action.
- Other scripts in `src/` are likely for manual data maintenance/correction.
- Decided to limit `README.md` history display and create a separate static page for full history search, both featuring a prominent latest version download section.

# Product Context: Why Track Cursor Versions?

## 1. Problem Solved

Cursor AI is an AI-powered code editor that frequently updates. Key issues this project addresses:

- **Automatic Updates**: Cursor often updates automatically, preventing users from easily staying on a preferred older version.
- **Version Preference**: Some users prefer specific older versions due to stability, feature changes, or user experience differences.
- **Accessibility**: Finding official download links for specific older versions can be difficult as they might not be prominently displayed on the official website.
- **Feature Tracking**: Users may want to know when specific key features were introduced to decide which version to use (e.g., model support like Deepseek or Claude 3.7).

## 2. User Needs

This project serves users who:

- Need to downgrade to a specific previous version of Cursor.
- Want to try the absolute latest preview/insider builds obtained via update checks before they hit the main download page.
- Require a reliable, centralized source for all official Cursor download links across different platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux) and architectures (x64, arm64).
- Wish to track the release history and significant feature introductions over time.

## 3. Project Value

By providing a comprehensive and easily accessible list of official download links and version history, this project empowers users with the freedom to choose the Cursor version that best suits their needs, overcoming the limitations of automatic updates and scattered information.

# Project Progress & Status

## 1. Current Status

- **Overall**: Project is established and functional. Core update mechanism and GitHub Pages deployment are automated via GitHub Actions. Memory Bank is up-to-date.
- **Data**: `version-history.json` contains data up to version 0.48.7. Potential data quality issues remain unaddressed.
- **Presentation**: 
    - `README.md` displays the latest 10 versions, updated correctly by the workflow.
    - A basic GitHub Pages site exists in `docs/` providing a searchable full version history.
- **Automation**: 
    - `update-cursor-links.yml` workflow runs hourly, updating data and README.
    - `deploy-gh-pages.yml` workflow runs on pushes to `main`, deploying the site from `docs/`.
- **Scripts**: Core update scripts are functioning. Site script (`docs/script.js`) fetches and displays data. Other maintenance scripts exist.
- **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect the creation of the GitHub Pages site and deployment workflow.

## 2. What Works

- Centralized tracking of Cursor download links in `version-history.json`.
- Automated hourly checks for new versions and updates to `version-history.json`.
- Automated regeneration of the `README.md` table with the latest 10 versions.
- Automated deployment of the GitHub Pages site from the `docs/` directory.
- Basic GitHub Pages site displaying searchable full version history.
- Memory Bank system is active and updated.
- Git history reflects recent changes.

## 3. What's Left / Next Steps

1.  **Review Dependencies**: Examine `package.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. (Current Focus)
2.  **Data Cleanup (Optional/Future)**: Address potential duplicate entries and missing links in `version-history.json`.
3.  **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitor workflow runs (update and deployment) and address any future issues.
4.  **GitHub Pages Site Enhancements (Future)**: Consider adding platform filtering or other improvements.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Potential duplicate version entries in `version-history.json`.
- Some historical versions might be missing specific platform links in `version-history.json`.

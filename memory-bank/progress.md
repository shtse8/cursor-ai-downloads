# Project Progress & Status

## 1. Current Status

- **Overall**: Project is established and functional. Core update mechanism via GitHub Actions is in place.
- **Data**: `version-history.json` contains data up to version 0.48.7. Some potential duplicate entries (e.g., 0.42.1, 0.42.0, 0.41.3, 0.41.2, 0.40.4) and missing links (e.g., win32 for 0.47.2) were observed but not yet addressed.
- **Presentation**: `README.md` displays version 0.48.7 as the latest and includes a comprehensive table. Data appears consistent with `version-history.json`.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow runs hourly to execute `src/update-cursor-links.ts`.
- **Scripts**: Core update script (`update-cursor-links.ts`) and several data maintenance/backfill scripts (`update-readme-*.ts`, `backfill-*.ts`) exist and their functions are understood.
- **Memory Bank**: Initialized and populated with findings from the initial analysis.

## 2. What Works

- Centralized tracking of Cursor download links.
- Automated hourly checks for new versions via GitHub Actions.
- `README.md` provides a user-facing view of the data.
- Scripts exist for both automated updates and manual data correction.

## 3. What's Left / Next Steps

1.  **Dependency Review**: Examine `package.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
2.  **Data Cleanup (Optional/Future)**: Address potential duplicate entries and missing links in `version-history.json` if deemed necessary.
3.  **Git Commit**: Commit the initialized Memory Bank.
4.  **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitor workflow runs and address any future data inconsistencies or API changes from Cursor.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Potential duplicate version entries in `version-history.json`.
- Some historical versions might be missing specific platform links in `version-history.json`.

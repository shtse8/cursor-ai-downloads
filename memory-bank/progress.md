# Project Progress & Status

## 1. Current Status

- **Overall**: Project is established and functional. Core update mechanism via GitHub Actions is fixed and correctly updates both `version-history.json` and the `README.md` table (last 10 versions). Memory Bank initialized and up-to-date.
- **Data**: `version-history.json` contains data up to version 0.48.7. Potential data quality issues (duplicates, missing links) remain unaddressed.
- **Presentation**: `README.md` has been rewritten, includes markers for the table, and displays only the last 10 versions, updated correctly by the automated workflow.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow runs hourly, executing `update-cursor-links.ts` followed by `update-readme-from-history.ts`, ensuring data and presentation consistency.
- **Scripts**: Core update scripts (`update-cursor-links.ts`, `update-readme-from-history.ts`) are functioning correctly within the automated workflow. Other maintenance scripts exist.
- **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect the fixed core update logic and confirm the next steps.

## 2. What Works

- Centralized tracking of Cursor download links in `version-history.json`.
- Automated hourly checks for new versions and updates to `version-history.json`.
- Automated regeneration of the `README.md` table with the latest 10 versions.
- `README.md` provides a concise, user-facing view of the latest 10 versions and project info.
- Memory Bank system is active and updated.
- Git history reflects recent changes and fixes.

## 3. What's Left / Next Steps

1.  **GitHub Pages Site - Planning**: Design the static site for full version search and latest download functionality. (Current Focus)
2.  **GitHub Pages Site - Implementation**: Build the static site (HTML/CSS/JS) and configure the deployment workflow.
3.  **Dependency Review**: Examine `package.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
4.  **Data Cleanup (Optional/Future)**: Address potential duplicate entries and missing links in `version-history.json`.
5.  **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitor workflow runs and address any future data inconsistencies or API changes from Cursor.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Potential duplicate version entries in `version-history.json`.
- Some historical versions might be missing specific platform links in `version-history.json`.

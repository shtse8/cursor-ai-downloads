# Project Progress & Status

## 1. Current Status

- **Overall**: Project is established and functional. Core update mechanism and GitHub Pages deployment are automated. Layout reverted to original multi-column table. README formatting fixed. GitHub Pages layout for latest version fixed. Memory Bank is up-to-date.
- **Data**: `version-history.json` contains data up to version 0.48.7. Potential data quality issues remain unaddressed.
- **Presentation**: 
    - `README.md` displays a prominent latest version section and the latest 10 versions in the original multi-column table format.
    - GitHub Pages site in `docs/` mirrors the README structure with a vertically-arranged latest version section and a searchable full version history table in the original multi-column format.
- **Automation**: 
    - `update-cursor-links.yml` workflow runs hourly, updating data and README.
    - `deploy-gh-pages.yml` workflow runs on pushes to `main`, deploying the site from `docs/`.
- **Scripts**: Core update scripts and site script (`docs/script.js`) are updated to reflect the reverted table structure and fixed Pages layout.
- **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect Pages layout fix.

## 2. What Works

- Centralized tracking of Cursor download links in `version-history.json`.
- Automated hourly checks for new versions and updates to `version-history.json`.
- Automated regeneration of the `README.md` (latest version section + original multi-column table).
- Automated deployment of the GitHub Pages site.
- GitHub Pages site displaying latest version (responsive layout) and searchable full history with original multi-column table.
- Correctly formatted README.md.
- Memory Bank system is active and updated.
- Git history reflects recent changes, reverts, and fixes.

## 3. What's Left / Next Steps

1.  **Review Dependencies**: Examine `package.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. (Current Focus)
2.  **Data Cleanup (Optional/Future)**: Address potential duplicate entries and missing links in `version-history.json`.
3.  **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitor workflow runs (update and deployment) and address any future issues.
4.  **GitHub Pages Site Enhancements (Future)**: Consider adding platform filtering or other improvements.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Potential duplicate version entries in `version-history.json`.
- Some historical versions might be missing specific platform links in `version-history.json`.

# Project Progress & Status

## 1. Current Status

- **Overall**: Project is established and functional. Core update mechanism via GitHub Actions is in place. Memory Bank initialized.
- **Data**: `version-history.json` contains data up to version 0.48.7. Potential data quality issues (duplicates, missing links) remain unaddressed.
- **Presentation**: `README.md` has been **rewritten** to be more engaging, includes the correct Buy Me a Coffee link, corrected workflow badge, and now displays only the **last 10 versions** for brevity.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow runs hourly to execute `src/update-cursor-links.ts`. *Needs verification/update to ensure compatibility with the new README format.*
- **Scripts**: Core update script (`update-cursor-links.ts`) and data maintenance scripts exist. *Need adaptation to work with the revised README structure.*
- **Memory Bank**: Initialized and updated with recent changes and next steps.

## 2. What Works

- Centralized tracking of Cursor download links in `version-history.json`.
- Automated hourly checks for new versions (core logic).
- `README.md` provides a concise, user-facing view of the latest data and project info.
- Memory Bank system is active.

## 3. What's Left / Next Steps

1.  **Script Adaptation**: Modify scripts in `src/` (e.g., `update-cursor-links.ts`) to align with the new `README.md` structure (displaying only the last 10 versions in the table).
2.  **GitHub Pages Site - Planning**: Design the static site for full version search and latest download functionality.
3.  **GitHub Pages Site - Implementation**: Build the static site (HTML/CSS/JS) and configure the deployment workflow.
4.  **Dependency Review**: Examine `package.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
5.  **Data Cleanup (Optional/Future)**: Address potential duplicate entries and missing links in `version-history.json`.
6.  **Git Commit**: Commit recent changes (`README.md`, Memory Bank updates).
7.  **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitor workflow runs and address any future data inconsistencies or API changes from Cursor.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Potential duplicate version entries in `version-history.json`.
- Some historical versions might be missing specific platform links in `version-history.json`.
- **Scripts require updating** to match the new `README.md` format before the automated workflow can reliably update it.

# Project Progress & Status

## 1. Current Status

- **Overall**: Project is established and functional. Core update mechanism and GitHub Pages deployment are automated. Layout and content improved, including optimized table structure using symbol links. Memory Bank is up-to-date.
- **Data**: `version-history.json` contains data up to version 0.48.7. Potential data quality issues remain unaddressed.
- **Presentation**: 
    - `README.md` displays a prominent latest version section and the latest 10 versions in a compact table using symbol links (grouped by OS).
    - GitHub Pages site in `docs/` mirrors the README structure with a latest version section and a searchable full version history table using symbol links (grouped by OS).
- **Automation**: 
    - `update-cursor-links.yml` workflow runs hourly, updating data and README.
    - `deploy-gh-pages.yml` workflow runs on pushes to `main`, deploying the site from `docs/`.
- **Scripts**: Core update scripts and site script (`docs/script.js`) are updated to reflect presentation changes and use symbol links.
- **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect symbol link table optimization.

## 2. What Works

- Centralized tracking of Cursor download links in `version-history.json`.
- Automated hourly checks for new versions and updates to `version-history.json`.
- Automated regeneration of the `README.md` (latest version section + optimized symbol link table).
- Automated deployment of the GitHub Pages site.
- GitHub Pages site displaying latest version and searchable full history with optimized symbol link table.
- Improved presentation and table compactness on both README and GitHub Pages.
- Memory Bank system is active and updated.
- Git history reflects recent changes.

## 3. What's Left / Next Steps

1.  **Review Dependencies**: Examine `package.json` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. (Current Focus)
2.  **Data Cleanup (Optional/Future)**: Address potential duplicate entries and missing links in `version-history.json`.
3.  **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitor workflow runs (update and deployment) and address any future issues.
4.  **GitHub Pages Site Enhancements (Future)**: Consider adding platform filtering or other improvements.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

- Potential duplicate version entries in `version-history.json`.
- Some historical versions might be missing specific platform links in `version-history.json`.
